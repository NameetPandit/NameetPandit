        <h2>A letter to Gudur</h2>
        <p>It was a rather weird time in my life, being in arguably the most uncertain period for any engineering student- the eighth semester. </p>
        <p>
            Eighth semester is the most deceptive time of the course. On the face of it, it may seem rather lenient. Yeah, you don't have to attend lectures, I get it. But in serenity too, there lies chaos. You have to worry about placements, assignments and the most dreaded- final year project!(Still have nightmares about it!)
        </p>
        <p>
            I can go on about the eighth semester, but that is for some other day. This is about one simple 5-day trip to Andhra Pradesh. 2 days in Tirupati and 3 in Gudur. Those of you unaware, Gudur is a town located in the Tirupati district itself. No, Gudur is not even a native for me. Circumstances forced Dad to call this place home for one and a half year. 

        </p>
        <p>
            This town, home to about eighty thousand,influenced me in ways more than one. For starters(no pun intended), at a breakfast joint, Idli, Dosa and Vada, all priced at â‚¹5 a piece, was the best breakfast I ever had in my life. Sankranthiki Vasthunam had just created ripples at the box office, and the songs from the movie did the same in my head too!!


        </p>
        <p>
            This got me thinking, yes, I do that sometimes. Can national highways be this drivable? Can quality food even be this cheap? Can life be this simple? As someone raised in the concrete ravines of Pune, hustling to reach Shivaji Chowk from Radha Chowk with all my bones intact, in a PMPML bus, Gudur was an anomaly!

        </p>
        <p>
            Surely, this felt more than just a family trip. A whole new avenue of thoughts opened to me. This trip although brief, gave me one thing which I lacked throughout the last three and a half years- perspective. The fear of not getting placed started to alleviate. Hell, I'll just come to Gudur and start selling Vada Pav if nothing works out for me! 

        </p>
        <p>
            Now, 6 months passed already since that trip, Dad changed jobs and is no longer in Gudur. Maybe I'll come back to Gudur some day carrying a bucket full of nostalgia! Until then, never change, Gudur. You met me at a very weird time in my life, and changed it completely. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Until next time..
